<h4>Plugins</h4>
<p>By default OBS comes with some plugins installed. You can check those out using the Plugins button in the OBS Interface:</p>

<h4>How to install a Plugin</h4>
<p>On the OBS forum you can already find different kinds of plugins. These normally come in 2 different forms. Either a packaged file (split  into a 32bit and 64bit version) or a direct download DLL file (in most cases also available in 32bit or 64bit flavour). </p>
<ol>
	<li>First check which version of OBS you are using. (32bit or 64bit is noted in the Window title)</li>
	<li>Download the plugin for your OBS bit version</li>
	<li>If its a zip/rar/7z file, extract it completely and with all sub-folders into the correct folder (see 4.)</li>
	<li>The OBS installation folder can be different depending on your Operating System. </li>
	<li>On a 32bit Windows you can only install the OBS 32bit version, and by default it uses the folder:
	<ul>
		<li>C:\Program Files\OBS\ -&gt; everything goes into the plugins folder  </li>
	</ul>
	On a 64bit Windows the installer sets up both the 32bit and the 64bit version for you. So if you use the 32bit version extract everything to:
	<ul>
		<li>C:\Program Files(x86)\OBS\plugins</li>
	</ul>
	And the 64bit plugins go to:
	<ul>
		<li>C:\Program Files\OBS\plugins</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Now you can start OBS and check the plugins list to see if everything worked and the plugin shows up. Some plugins also have to be configured using this menu.</li>
</ol>
