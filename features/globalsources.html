<h4>Global Sources</h4>
<p>Global sources are sources that are independent of scenes, and persist until the stream ends.
They start up when first used, and are destroyed only when a stream ends. A regular source on the other hand is created when the scene is created, and destroyed when the scene changes.
For a web camera and capture cards you do not want this to happen as loading and unloading devices takes time, so global sources are especially useful and recommended for such video devices. Bitmaps and similar sources on the other hand do not need to be global sources as loading and unloading them is near instant.</p>
