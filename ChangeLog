(yyyy-mm-dd)


-------------------------------

2012-9-08 - 0.34 (alpha)
    * Reworked network publish code, added I-Frame-Delay algorithm to
      automatically drop frames based upon usage if possible
    * Added a little network control thing so users can see their
      bandwidth usage, and to see if there's any network strain
    * 7.1 should no longer have sound issues, but code is still
      experimental
    * updated x264 settings, was using a poor setting choice.  should
      give a much better compression ratio now under most CPU presets.
    * tweaked capture code again, didn't like the way window capture
      would display a black box every time you minimized a window.
      instead it now just freezes the frame.
    * Added the ability to type in custom resolution in the directshow
      video devices plugin.
   
-------------------------------

2012-9-06 - 0.33 (alpha)
    * Fixed issue with bitmaps of non-power-of-two sizes not displaying
    * Added region capture and window specific capture.  Window specific
      capture seems super fast.  Was getting like 50-60 FPS average from
      starcraft 2 for example.
    * Fixed some other minor issues and potential bugs
    * Added own3d with some servers to the services list


-------------------------------

2012-9-01 - 0.32 (alpha)
    * Fixed a crash when adding sources in some situations
    * Fixed some crashes related to audio code, forgot to make sure
      that the audio buffers were on a 128bit boundry before using SSE
      instructions (happened to me as well).  Which means mics and audio
      devices should hopefully work properly now.
    * Fixed a potential crash with x264 (Apparently you should only really
      query the x264 header packets before it starts encoding, otherwise
      you risk crashing)
    * Fixed a MAJOR bug with framerates and video smoothness, the cause
      was due to the fact that b-frames can have a reverse timestamp after
      p-frames, and I did not take that into account when sending packets.
      Updated the AVC packet code, frames are now displaying at the
      intended intervals.  Wow was that one difficult to pinpoint, as well
      as fix.
    * Added 7.1 speaker support, apparently I didn't actually put it in.
      People have some nice speaker setups.

-------------------------------

2012-8-28 - 0.31 (alpha)
    * Received my video capture card, discovered a few bugs
      in my DirectShow code that needed fixing
    * Made DirectShow work with a few YUV planar formats

-------------------------------

2012-8-26 - 0.3 (alpha)
    * Finished first version of the API DLL interface so that
      developers can write their own plugins
    * Finished first version of the DirectShow device plugin,
      still needs some testing
    * Refactored audio code and mixer due to minor code design
      flaws I didn't forsee
    * Completely rewrote graphics code, made a graphics wrapper
      so that D3D11 is completely handled behind the scenes
    * Added ability to use global sources that persist until
      the stream ends (best used for video devices)
    * Fixed a ton of bugs

-------------------------------

2012-8-10 - 0.2 (alpha)
    * First "usable" state, still many features to be written
