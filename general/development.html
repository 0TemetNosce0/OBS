<h4>Excerpt from INSTALL file</td>

<p>---------------------------------------------<br />
        Compiling<br />
---------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>Required (and included) libraries:<br />
      libmp3lame - MP3 encoder - obs/lame<br />
      libfaac - AAC encoder - obs/libfaac<br />
      librtmp - RTMP protocol - obs/librtmp<br />
      libsamplerate - audio resampler - obs/libsamplerate<br />
      libx264 - x264 encoder - obs/x264</p>
<p>To compile OBS and all its sub-libraries, you can use OBS-All.sln<br />
      and compile everything all at once, or you can compile everything<br />
      individually yourself. x264 and libmp3lame are pre-compiled for<br />
  convenience.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------<br />
      Windows SDK<br />
      ---------------------------------------------<br />
      It requires the latest windows SDK, as it uses features from<br />
      windows vista, windows 7 and 8. The windows 8 SDK should also come<br />
  with the latest DirectX includes and libraries</p>
    <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
      Compiling LAME (if desired)<br />
      ---------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>I compile lame through the VC makefile.</p>
<p>Command line: nmake -f Makefile.MSVC CPU=P3</p>
    <p>Get nasm if you want to compile with assembly, otherwise use ASM=NO<br />
      command line option. Use MSVCVER=Win64 to compile 64bit. View<br />
      lame/makefile.msvc for more info.
    <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
      Compiling x264 (if desired)<br />
    ---------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>x264 is slightly more troublesome, primarily because it's written in<br />
      C99, yasm, and compile configuration is totally dependent on bash<br />
      scripts. Usually it's recommended to cross-compile on linux, but I just<br />
      used msys and mingw for windows. There's a guide on how to get x264<br />
compiled on windows at http://doom10.org/index.php?topic=26.0</p>
    <p>Make sure to use the --enable-win32thread configuration option,<br />
      though I suppose you could make it use posix threads with a bit of work,<br />
      but it's fairly pointless and you'd probably have to add some more stuff<br />
      to the Hacks.cpp file.</p>
<p>If compiling static (which I don't do anymore), please make sure to<br />
      include the static libgcc.a that your mingw provides. Depending on your<br />
      mingw version you may need to add/remove stuff from Hacks.cpp to get it<br />
      properly working. It sucks, I know, but I'm not the one who decided to<br />
      make x264 uncompilable on microsoft's C compiler.</p>
    <p>---------------------------------------------<br />
      Other notes<br />
    ---------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>You may have noted that every single library I use is statically linked.<br />
      Even the CRT is static on all projects. Personally, I despise having any<br />
      outside DLL dependencies. Having to install the damn visual studio<br />
      runtimes every single time you install an application is the most annoying<br />
      thing on earth. Sure, I understand why they're used, and I know that there<br />
      are often vulnerabilities that need to be patched, but I personally go<br />
      around it by centralizing all such stuff in the utility library (see the<br />
      Utility files in OBSApi). Generally when I get an application I like it<br />
      to work right from the start with as little setup as possible. It's a<br />
personal preference.</p>
    <p>If you need to allocate, use the Allocate and Free functions. new and<br />
      delete is automatically wrapped to these as well.</p>
    <p>At some point in time I will get around to some proper documentation of<br />
      the utility library, but in the mean time, look around in the utility files<br />
      of OBSApi if you wish.</p>
