<h4>Excerpt from INSTALL file</h4>
<pre>---------------------------------------------
Compiling
---------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>Required (and included) libraries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        libmp3lame - MP3 encoder - obs/lame</li>
      <li>libfaac - AAC encoder - obs/libfaac</li>
      <li>librtmp - RTMP protocol - obs/librtmp</li>
      <li>libsamplerate - audio resampler - obs/libsamplerate</li>
      <li>libx264 - x264 encoder - obs/x264</li>
    </ul>
<p>To compile OBS and all its sub-libraries, you can use OBS-All.sln and compile everything all at once, or you can compile everything individually yourself. x264 and libmp3lame are pre-compiled for convenience.</p>
<pre>---------------------------------------------
Windows SDK
---------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>It requires the latest windows SDK, as it uses features from Windows Vista, Windows 7 and 8. The Windows 8 SDK should also come with the latest DirectX includes and libraries.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------<br />
Compiling LAME (if desired)<br />
---------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I compile lame through the VC makefile.</p>
<p>Command line: nmake -f Makefile.MSVC CPU=P3</p>
<p>Get nasm if you want to compile with assembly, otherwise use ASM=NO command line option. Use MSVCVER=Win64 to compile 64bit. View lame/makefile.msvc for more info.</p>
<pre>---------------------------------------------
Compiling x264 (if desired)
---------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>x264 is slightly more troublesome, primarily because it's written in C99, yasm, and compile configuration is totally dependent on bash scripts. Usually it's recommended to cross-compile on linux, but I just used msys and mingw for windows. There's a guide on how to get x264 compiled on windows at http://doom10.org/index.php?topic=26.0</p>
<p>Make sure to use the --enable-win32thread configuration option, though I suppose you could make it use posix threads with a bit of work, but it's fairly pointless and you'd probably have to add some more stuff to the Hacks.cpp file.</p>
<p>If compiling static (which I don't do anymore), please make sure to include the static libgcc.a that your mingw provides. Depending on your mingw version you may need to add/remove stuff from Hacks.cpp to get it properly working. It sucks, I know, but I'm not the one who decided to make x264 uncompilable on microsoft's C compiler.</p>

Other notes
---------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>You may have noted that every single library I use is statically linked. Even the CRT is static on all projects. Personally, I despise having any outside DLL dependencies. Having to install the damn visual studio runtimes every single time you install an application is the most annoying thing on earth. Sure, I understand why they're used, and I know that there are often vulnerabilities that need to be patched, but I personally go around it by centralizing all such stuff in the utility library (see the Utility files in OBSApi). Generally when I get an application I like it to work right from the start with as little setup as possible. It's a personal preference.</p>
<p>If you need to allocate, use the Allocate and Free functions. new and delete is automatically wrapped to these as well.</p>
<p>At some point in time I will get around to some proper documentation of the utility library, but in the mean time, look around in the utility files of OBSApi if you wish.</p>
