<h4>Server Authentication</h4>
<p>Some online services tend to use rtmp Servers like Wowza and similar. These servers often need you to authenticate yourself with your username and password instead of a stream key. </p>
<p>To enter a Username and Password you just have to add them to your &quot;profile name.ini&quot; which is located in the %appdata%\OBS\profiles folder. If you are not using a special profile, just use the untitled.ini, search for the section [Publish] and add the following two lines:</p>
<pre>UserName=[type username]
Password=[type password]</pre>
<p>to this section. Of course without the [ ] brackets. Make sure OBS is closed while you change your profile.ini, or restart OBS afterwards. Then setup your server address in the Broadcast settings as usual and start streaming.</p>
