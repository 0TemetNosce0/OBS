<h4>Frequently asked Questions</h4>
<section id="faq-list">
<h3>Is OBS completely free?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>OBS is completely, 100% free. You don't have to pay for it at all. It is a great, high quality program that excels at streaming and recording. It is completely virus and malware free.</p>
</div>
<h3>Will this ever work on Windows XP? What about Mac and Linux?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Windows XP unfortunately lacks DirectX 10 features and the audio subsystem present in Vista and up that OBS makes use of, and as such, will never be supported. OBS is currently being rewritten as multi-platform under the name OBS Studio. It will be available for Windows, Mac and Linux when it is done.</p>
</div>
<h3>What settings should I use?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Check out our <a href="https://obsproject.com/estimator">settings estimator</a> for general recommendations based on your setup</p>
</div>
<h3>What are scenes and sources?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>A scene &quot;holds&quot; the list and order of the sources you add to it. Sources are for example images, a webcam input, window or monitor capture, anything you would want to add to your recording. So you can set up different Scenes that will hold different sources. For example a &quot;welcome&quot; scene with a picture and some text. A &quot;game&quot; scene that shows the game you want to stream and your webcam and an &quot;end&quot; scene that will show a &quot;thanks for watching&quot; message or whatever you want. The amount of scenes is not limited in OBS and the amount of sources per scene aint limited either.</p>
  <p>If you are familiar with tools like Photoshop, a scene is similar to the Canvas or a Page in a Photoshop file while the sources are the different layers.</p>

<h3>I cannot find the 64bit Version of OBS, where can I get it?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>You already have the 64bit version if you used the installer. It can be found in your Start Menu under Programs -&gt; Open Broadcaster Software -&gt; Open Broadcaster Software (64 bit). If you still can't find it, it is usually in C:\Program Files\OBS. Be aware that the 64 bit version is not compatible with certain video devices and plugins, there is rarely a reason to use it.</p>

<h3>I got an error "Could not initialize DirectX 10 on [your GPU]"</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Your graphics card does not have sufficient support for DirectX 10. It does not matter if you have newer versions of DirectX software installed; your hardware does not support the necessary features, and no you cannot do anything about it apart from upgrading it.</p>

<h3>I want to stream League of Legends, whats the best way to do it?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>The best way to stream LoL is to set up 2 scenes. First, keep Aero enabled. Then, in the first scene, have a Window Capture of the LoL client, and in the second scene, have a Game Capture of the actual LoL game (or Window capture if the game is in windowed or borderless mode). Then use the Simple Scene Switcher to automatically swap between them: <a target="_blank" href="https://obsproject.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1785">https://obsproject.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=1785</a> Avoid Monitor capture altogether.</p>
</div>
<h3>My Monitor capture runs very slow, but why?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use Monitor Capture on Windows Vista/7. Instead, try adding a Game Capture source and selecting "[DWM] Monitor Capture" from the list of capture targets. Aero must be <strong>ENABLED</strong> and only the primary screen will be captured.</p>
</div>
<h3>My window capture shows all windows, not only the one I want to capture</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Enable your windows aero theme (taskbar and window transparency): <a target="_blank" href="http://en.kioskea.net/faq/30281-how-to-rapidly-enable-or-disable-aero-under-windows-7">http://en.kioskea.net/faq/30281-how-to-rapidly-enable-or-disable-aero-under-windows-7</a></p>

<h3>The start recording button is grayed out, or I want to do a local recording</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Go to &quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Broadcast Settings&quot; and check "Save to file", click &quot;Browse&quot; and navigate to the desired location, enter a file name, or enter <strong>%</strong> to have the files named automatically, and click &quot;Save&quot;. If you do not stream, set Mode to "File Output Only" and follow this guide: <a target="_blank" href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-make-high-quality-local-recordings.16/">https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-make-high-quality-local-recordings.16/</a></p>
</div>
<h3>The quick sync selection is grayed out but I definitely have all necessary features in my system</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>If the Quick Sync option in OBS is grayed out, follow this tutorial: <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-use-quicksync.82/">https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-use-quicksync.82/</a></p>

</div>
<h3>My recorded video is either black or has no sound, what can I do?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>If you're playing back a video created with OBS but there's no audio, and you're using Windows Media Player or QuickTime Player, you're missing codecs required to play back the audio properly. Use VLC instead: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a></p>
</div>
<h3>I have a black screen and can't see my stream</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Firstly, make sure you have created a scene and added a source to actually be seen. After that, you'll need to turn on 'Preview Stream' or be streaming in order to see your stream</p>
</div>
<h3>Why can't I move any sources that I added?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>You need to be previewing your stream, or actually streaming and click 'Edit Scene' to move things around. You can also hold Ctrl while moving a source to prevent it from snapping to the screen edges, Shift while resizing to ignore the aspect ratio, and Alt while dragging the edge of a source to crop.</p>
</div>
<h3>One of my actual sources is black and not showing up</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Are you trying to stream a fullscreen game? You'll need to hook into it using the 'Game Capture' source in OBS. As well, OpenGL games like Minecraft have issues with Window Capture and you'll need to use Monitor Capture to show them. If desktop capture is showing up as black, it indicates that you either need to update windows or update DirectX.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I use 4K resolutions?</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>4k is supported fine but you need to use the "high" encoding profile in settings -&gt; advanced, it will require up to 4 times as much processing power as encoding 1080p</p>
</div>
<h3>Which capture card should I get for streaming or recording? And do I need one? (avoid USB 2.0 capture devices if at all possible) </h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.helping-squad.com/which-capture-card-should-i-get-for-streaming-or-recording/">http://www.helping-squad.com/which-capture-card-should-i-get-for-streaming-or-recording/</a></p>
</div>
<h3>Why is my capture card showing up as a red box on my stream</h3>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Your capture device may still be unsupported -- please visit the Problems and Bugs forum and <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=59">read the thread regarding red output from devices</a>.</p>
