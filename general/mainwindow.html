</div>
<div class="own_grid2"><h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sources/">Sources</a></h4>
<p>A "source" is typically individual images or video input which make up the currently selected scene. You can add, remove, or modify sources in a scene by simply right clicking the sources list box.</p>
</div>
<div class="own_grid2" style="width:100% !important;"><h4>Auxiliary and Desktop volume</h4>
<p>These volume adjusters control how loud your audio output is to the stream.</p>
<p>The left volume adjuster controls the auxiliary/microphone device you use (if any), and the right volume adjuster controls desktop sound.</p>

</div>
<div class="own_grid2"><h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/features/globalsources.html">Global Sources</a></h4>
<p>Global sources are sources that are independent of scenes, and persist until the stream ends. They start up when first used, and are destroyed when a stream ends.  This is especially useful and recommended for say video devices such as web cameras or capture cards, or desktop capture. It is not really necessary for other things like regular bitmaps and such.</p>
</div>

<p>Allows you test and view your stream without actually going live.  It will also report your estimated bandwidth usage when complete.</p>
